# tamil_vowels_recognition_cnn_colab
Tamil is a language predominantly spoken in Tamilnadu, a state in southern part of India. In this repository, I've posted the CNN code for recognizing handwritten Tamil vowels (except the last vowel). I have trained the CNN and achieved training accuracy rate as 95.52% and validation accuracy as 97.65. The trained CNN is also capable of predicting any real-time handwritten image. I tested it with a randomly cropped image from google image search and it was a success.
